# Honeypot Attack Summary Report

**Report Generation Time:** 2025-10-28T12:06:16.202126Z
**Timeframe:** 2025-09-13T00:00:00.000Z to 2025-10-19T23:59:59.999Z

### Executive Summary

This report details the malicious activity observed across our distributed honeypot network between September 13, 2025, and October 19, 2025. During this period, the network recorded approximately **8,324,762** attacks. The activity was overwhelmingly characterized by automated, large-scale campaigns focused on exploiting legacy vulnerabilities and conducting brute-force login attempts against common services.

The primary sources of attacks were concentrated in the United States, Germany, and China, with the vast majority of malicious traffic originating from commercial hosting providers and cloud platforms. **DigitalOcean (AS14061)** and **Global Connectivity Solutions (AS215540)** were the top sources of attacks, highlighting the continued abuse of legitimate infrastructure by threat actors to launch their campaigns.

Attackers showed a strong preference for targeting extremely old and well-known vulnerabilities. The most frequently scanned-for vulnerability was **CVE-2006-2369**, a critical authentication bypass in RealVNC, followed by **CVE-2005-4050**, a buffer overflow in Multi-Tech VoIP devices. This indicates that a significant portion of global attack traffic is generated by botnets using legacy exploit kits that still find success against unpatched and forgotten systems.

Analysis of attacker techniques revealed specific, noteworthy minutia. The use of the non-standard command `lockr -ia .ssh` was observed, which OSINT confirms is part of a custom attacker toolkit designed to secure persistent SSH access after a compromise. Furthermore, the credentials `345gs5662d34` and `3245gs5662d34` were used in tens of thousands of login attempts. These are not random strings but are known signatures of a widespread botnet, likely targeting default credentials for a specific model of IoT device.

In summary, the threat landscape during this period was dominated by low-sophistication, high-volume attacks targeting low-hanging fruit. There is no evidence directly linking the observed activity to major zero-day vulnerabilities or significant world events from the timeframe. Instead, the data paints a clear picture of the internet's background noise: a relentless, automated barrage targeting systemic weaknesses in patch management and password hygiene.

### OSINT Investigations

#### OSINT on High-Frequency IPs

*   **2.57.121.61 (AS47890 - UNMANAGED LTD, Romania):** This IP was the top attacker during the analysis period. Threat intelligence confirms it is a malicious actor actively involved in SIP (VoIP) attacks. This directly correlates with the partial honeypot data showing a high volume of attacks against the `sentrypeer` (VoIP) honeypot. The hosting provider's "unmanaged" nature makes it a favorable environment for threat actors.
*   **92.205.59.208 (AS21499 - Host Europe GmbH/GoDaddy, Germany):** While this specific IP does not have direct adverse reports, it is part of a large hosting provider's network where neighboring IPs have been flagged for spam and brute-force attacks. This suggests attackers are likely cycling through IPs within large, reputable hosting blocks to evade simple blocklists.

#### OSINT on CVEs

*   **CVE-2006-2369:** This was the most scanned-for vulnerability. It is a critical authentication bypass in RealVNC 4.1.1. An attacker can simply request an insecure connection type to gain full control. Its prevalence, nearly two decades after disclosure, highlights the vast number of unpatched, internet-exposed devices (e.g., remote access systems, embedded devices) that remain vulnerable to automated exploitation via publicly available tools like Metasploit.
*   **CVE-2005-4050:** The second most common CVE is a buffer overflow in Multi-Tech VoIP devices, triggered by a malformed SIP INVITE message. Its continued presence in attack traffic points to the operation of legacy botnets that are still programmed to scan for these old but effective exploits against unmanaged network hardware.

#### OSINT on Commands and Credentials

*   **`lockr -ia .ssh` Command:** This command is not a standard Linux utility. OSINT confirms it is part of a malicious toolset brought onto a compromised machine by an attacker. It is used in a sequence to modify SSH `authorized_keys` for persistent access and then attempts to make the SSH configuration directory immutable, locking the legitimate user out from easily removing the attacker's backdoor.
*   **`345gs5662d34` / `3245gs5662d34` Credentials:** These unique strings were used as both a username and a password tens of thousands of times. OSINT reveals these are well-known signatures of a specific, widespread botnet. The leading theory is that they are the hardcoded default credentials for a particular device, possibly a Polycom IP phone, which the botnet is relentlessly scanning for across the internet.

### Key Observations and Anomalies

*   **Dominance of Legacy Exploits:** The overwhelming focus on CVEs from 2006 and 2005 demonstrates that the bulk of automated attack traffic is not sophisticated. It relies on a "long tail" of unpatched, often forgotten, internet-facing devices. This is a systemic issue of poor asset management and patching hygiene on a global scale.
*   **Botnet Fingerprints:** The high-frequency use of the `345gs5662d34` credentials serves as a clear fingerprint for a specific botnet. Observing this pattern allows for confident attribution of a large volume of disparate attacks to a single, coordinated campaign.
*   **Attacker TTPs in Plain Sight:** The `lockr` command sequence provides a clear glimpse into the post-exploitation techniques of attackers. They are not just gaining initial access but are deploying custom tools to solidify their persistence on the compromised host.
*   **Data Gaps as a Finding:** The inability to retrieve data for top targeted ports and triggered NIDS signatures for this specific timeframe is a significant finding. It may suggest a problem with data collection, ingestion, or indexing for these specific fields, which warrants an internal technical review.

### General Trends and Minutia

The general trend observed is one of constant, low-level, automated threats that form the "background radiation" of the internet. These attacks are not tailored to current events but are opportunistic, pre-programmed campaigns scanning for a specific set of old vulnerabilities and weak credentials.

The minutia, however, reveals the underlying mechanics of these campaigns. Specific credentials act as botnet signatures, and unique commands show the attackers' operational playbook. While no zero-day fingerprints were detected, these details provide valuable intelligence for defenders, allowing them to create more specific detection rules and understand the TTPs of the botnets that constitute the majority of the threat landscape.
