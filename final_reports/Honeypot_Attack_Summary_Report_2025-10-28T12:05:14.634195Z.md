# Honeypot Attack Summary Report

**Report Generation Time:** 2025-10-28T11:58:32.083490Z
**Timeframe:** 2025-09-06T00:00:00.000Z to 2025-10-12T23:59:59.999Z

### Executive Summary

This report summarizes the malicious activity observed across our distributed honeypot network between September 6, 2025, and October 12, 2025. Over this period, the network registered a total of **4,985,855** attacks. The vast majority of this activity consisted of automated, indiscriminate scanning and brute-force attempts, originating from a diverse global network with a heavy concentration in the United States, Germany, and France.

Attackers predominantly leveraged hosting providers and cloud platforms, with DigitalOcean, Global Connectivity Solutions, and Host Europe GmbH being the top sources of malicious traffic. This highlights a persistent trend of attackers abusing legitimate infrastructure to launch their campaigns.

The primary attack vectors observed were brute-force login attempts and the exploitation of decade-old vulnerabilities. Login attempts overwhelmingly targeted the `root` user with simple passwords like `123456`. The most frequently targeted vulnerabilities were **CVE-2006-2369**, an authentication bypass in RealVNC, and **CVE-2002-0013/12**, a widespread flaw in SNMPv1 implementations. This indicates that a large volume of attack traffic is generated by legacy botnets or attackers using outdated but still effective exploit kits against unpatched systems.

Noteworthy findings during this period include the use of non-standard commands like `lockr`, a malicious tool used to secure attacker persistence by making SSH files immutable. Furthermore, over 200,000 alerts were triggered for the "DoublePulsar Backdoor" installation, suggesting that while the backdoor itself may be dated, widespread scanning for the underlying EternalBlue vulnerability remains a constant threat.

While the data does not show a direct correlation with the major zero-day vulnerabilities disclosed in September and October 2025, it paints a clear picture of the internet's "background noise"—a relentless barrage of automated attacks seeking to exploit the lowest-hanging fruit: weak credentials and unpatched legacy systems.

### OSINT Investigations

#### OSINT on High-Frequency IPs

*   **92.205.59.208 (AS21499 - Host Europe GmbH):** This IP is a persistent top attacker. It is flagged by multiple threat intelligence sources as malicious and is part of a network known for phishing, malware distribution, and brute-force attacks. Its continued high-volume activity marks it as a significant and unabating threat.
*   **176.65.141.117 (AS44592 - SkyLink Data Center BV):** This IP, hosted in the Netherlands, is listed on public blocklists for association with "Malware Networks" and "Mass Scanners." Reports specifically link it to brute-force attacks against email servers (SMTP), which aligns with the general profile of an automated attack platform.

#### OSINT on CVEs

*   **CVE-2006-2369:** This was the most frequently scanned-for vulnerability during the analysis period. It is a critical authentication bypass flaw in RealVNC version 4.1.1. An attacker can simply request an insecure connection type ("Type 1 - None") to gain full control of the VNC session. The high number of alerts indicates that vast swathes of the internet are still being scanned for this nearly two-decade-old vulnerability, likely by automated botnets searching for unpatched remote access systems.
*   **CVE-2002-0012 & CVE-2002-0013:** These related vulnerabilities in the SNMPv1 protocol are also relics of a past era but remain a common fixture in honeypot logs. They allow attackers to cause denial-of-service or gain administrative access by sending malformed SNMP messages (trap messages for CVE-2002-0012 and Get/Set requests for CVE-2002-0013). Their continued presence highlights the long tail of unpatched network hardware and embedded systems still in operation.

#### OSINT on Commands and Signatures

*   **`lockr` Command:** The command sequence `cd ~; chattr -ia .ssh; lockr -ia .ssh` is a clear indicator of a specific attacker TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). OSINT confirms `lockr` is not a standard Linux utility but is a malicious tool, likely a renamed `chattr` binary. This sequence is used to first remove immutability from the `.ssh` directory, allow the attacker to modify SSH keys for persistent access, and then use their own `lockr` tool to re-apply the immutable flag, thus locking in their backdoor and preventing legitimate users from easily removing it.
*   **DoublePulsar Signature:** The "ET EXPLOIT [PTsecurity] DoublePulsar Backdoor installation communication" signature was triggered over 200,000 times. DoublePulsar was a backdoor developed by the NSA and leaked in 2017, famously used with the EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010). While OSINT suggests DoublePulsar itself is a fading threat, the high number of alerts for its installation traffic strongly indicates that the EternalBlue exploit is still being used at scale to scan for vulnerable SMB services. Attackers are likely using the same delivery mechanism but may be dropping more modern payloads.

### General Trends and World Events

Analysis of major cybersecurity events during September and October 2025—including a record-breaking Microsoft Patch Tuesday, zero-day vulnerabilities in Unity and Dolby, and the end of support for Windows 10—shows little direct correlation with the activity observed in our honeypots. The attacks we registered were not sophisticated campaigns leveraging these new zero-days. Instead, our data reflects the constant, low-level hum of global, automated, and opportunistic attacks that form the background radiation of the internet. This demonstrates that for a vast number of attackers, the focus remains on exploiting old, unpatched vulnerabilities and weak credentials, a strategy that evidently still yields results.

### Key Observations and Anomalies

*   **Persistence of Legacy Exploits:** The dominance of CVEs from 2006 and 2002 is a stark reminder that many systems remain vulnerable to decades-old flaws. This is a critical area of concern, as it indicates a failure in patch management and asset lifecycle processes on a global scale.
*   **Infrastructure-as-a-Weapon:** The list of top attacker ASNs is almost exclusively composed of major cloud and hosting providers. This underscores the challenge of preventing malicious activity when attackers can easily and cheaply spin up resources on legitimate, high-reputation networks.
*   **Anomalous Credentials:** The username/password combination `345gs5662d34` and its variant `3245gs5662d34` were observed with high frequency. This is not a common default credential and, given its persistence from the previous reporting period, strongly suggests the activity of a specific, ongoing botnet or campaign using hardcoded credentials.
*   **VNC Under Siege:** The top triggered NIDS signature by a massive margin was "GPL INFO VNC server response" with over 3.7 million hits, directly correlating with the top CVE (`CVE-2006-2369`). This highlights an enormous amount of scanning and exploitation activity directed at the VNC protocol (remote desktop sharing), likely targeting industrial, commercial, or misconfigured personal systems.
