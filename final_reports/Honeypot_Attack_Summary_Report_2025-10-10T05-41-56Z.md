### Executive Summary

Over the past 12 hours, our honeypot network has detected a significant volume of malicious activity, totaling over 200,000 events. The majority of these attacks were automated and opportunistic, focusing on common vulnerabilities and weak credentials. The most frequently targeted services were SSH (port 22), SMB (port 445), and SIP (port 5060).

A large portion of the observed activity was generated by a small number of highly active IP addresses. The most prolific of these, `167.250.224.25`, has been flagged as suspicious and appears to be operating from either the United States or Brazil. Other significant sources of attacks include IP addresses located in Vietnam, Thailand, India, and a DigitalOcean server in the United States.

A consistent theme among the SSH-based attacks was the attempt to install a persistent SSH key for backdoor access. This was often preceded by a series of reconnaissance commands to fingerprint the system. The commands and usernames used suggest a high degree of automation.

The Suricata network security monitoring system detected a high volume of traffic related to the "DoublePulsar Backdoor," indicating widespread scanning for systems vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit. Additionally, our honeypots captured several malware samples, all of which were identified as variants of the Mozi and Mirai IoT botnets.

The CVEs targeted by attackers were a mix of older, well-known vulnerabilities and newer, critical ones. This suggests that attackers are casting a wide net, hoping to compromise both legacy systems and those that have not yet been patched against the latest threats. Of particular note are the active exploitation of CVE-2024-1709 (ConnectWise ScreenConnect) and CVE-2024-4577 (PHP-CGI), both of which are listed in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.

In summary, the threat landscape over the past 12 hours has been characterized by high-volume, automated attacks targeting a variety of services and vulnerabilities. The primary goal of these attacks appears to be the expansion of IoT botnets and the establishment of persistent access to compromised systems.

### Key Observations and Anomalies

*   **High-Volume, Automated Attacks:** The vast majority of the observed activity is characteristic of widespread, automated scanning and exploitation campaigns. The repetition in commands, IPs, and targeted ports across a short timeframe supports this conclusion.
*   **Focus on SSH Credential Hijacking:** A predominant attack vector is the attempt to add a new SSH public key to the `authorized_keys` file. This indicates a clear objective to establish persistent, passwordless access to compromised systems.
*   **Reconnaissance Post-Exploitation:** Attackers consistently attempt to gather system information (CPU, memory, kernel version) immediately after simulated breaches. This is a standard step to understand the compromised environment for further exploitation.
*   **Legacy and Modern Vulnerability Scanning:** The CVEs being targeted are a mix of old and new vulnerabilities, suggesting a strategy to find and compromise both unpatched legacy systems and those vulnerable to the latest threats. The active exploitation of recent, critical CVEs is a significant concern.
*   **Malware Delivery Attempts:** The downloading of shell scripts and files with names like `botx.mpsl` and `Mozi.m` points to attempts to deploy malware, likely for inclusion in a botnet. All of the identified malware is related to IoT botnets, highlighting the ongoing threat to these often-insecure devices.
*   **Suspicious Hostname:** The hostname "s10.internetresearch.center" associated with the DigitalOcean IP `159.65.237.176` is highly suspicious and warrants further investigation.
*   **"mdrfckr" Signature:** The `echo "ssh-rsa ... mdrfckr"` command is a clear attacker signature that has been observed in other campaigns.

This concludes the Honeypot Attack Summary Report. Continued monitoring of these trends is recommended.
