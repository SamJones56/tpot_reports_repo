An investigation was conducted to determine if our honeypot network was affected by the major AWS and Microsoft Azure outages that occurred in October 2025. The investigation involved analyzing the total number of attacks on our network on the days of the outages and comparing them to the days before and after.

**AWS Outage - October 20, 2025:**

A significant drop in attack volume was observed on the day of the AWS outage.
*   **October 19, 2025:** 479,363 attacks
*   **October 20, 2025 (Outage):** 307,968 attacks (a 35.7% decrease)
*   **October 21, 2025:** 287,475 attacks

**Microsoft Azure Outage - October 29, 2025:**

A similar trend was observed on the day of the Microsoft Azure outage.
*   **October 28, 2025:** 301,904 attacks
*   **October 29, 2025 (Outage):** 196,450 attacks (a 34.9% decrease)
*   **October 30, 2025:** 154,928 attacks

**Conclusion:**

The data strongly indicates that our honeypot network was affected by both the AWS and Microsoft Azure outages in October 2025. The sharp decrease in the number of attacks on the days of the outages suggests that the attackers' infrastructure may be reliant on these cloud services, or that the general disruption to internet traffic caused by the outages hindered their ability to conduct attacks. The continued low number of attacks in the days following the outages may point to a slow recovery for the attackers' systems.
