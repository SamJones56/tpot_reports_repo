**Executive Summary**

This report details the findings of an investigation into the impact of a series of significant geopolitical events in October 2025 on our honeypot network. The analysis reveals a clear and consistent correlation between real-world events, particularly those related to the conflict in Ukraine, and the volume, origin, and nature of cyberattacks observed on our network.

The key findings of this report are:

*   **Direct Spillover of a Physical Conflict into the Cyber Domain:** The events of October 2025 demonstrate a clear trend of the physical conflict in Ukraine spilling over into the cyber realm. The most direct evidence of this was the massive surge in attacks from Russia on October 16th, which directly coincided with a major Russian missile strike on Ukrainian gas infrastructure and a publicly reported, targeted cyberattack by a Russian state-sponsored actor.
*   **Dynamic and Escalating Threat Landscape:** The month of October saw a dramatic and sustained escalation in the volume of cyberattacks, with the total number of daily attacks increasing by over 300% from the beginning to the end of the month. The top sources of attacks were also highly dynamic, with several countries, including the Netherlands, Italy, and Singapore, making appearances in the top 10.
*   **Anomalous and Sustained Botnet Activity:** A massive and unprecedented volume of attacks was observed originating from Romania. This activity, which reached a peak of over 370,000 attacks in a 48-hour period, is attributed to significant botnet activity, including the long-running RUBYCARP (aka Outlaw) and the resurgent Prometei botnets.
*   **Shifting Cyber Postures:** The cyber activity of Ukraine was observed to shift in response to real-world events. During the most intense physical attacks, Ukraine disappeared from the list of top attacking countries, suggesting a shift to a defensive posture. As the physical attacks subsided, Ukraine re-emerged as a top source of attacks.

**Detailed Event-by-Event Analysis**

**1. European Political Community Summit (October 2nd)**

*   **Total Attacks (Oct 1-3):** 365,160
*   **Top Attacking Countries:** Brazil, United States, Germany, **Ukraine**
*   **Analysis:** The presence of Ukraine in the top 4 was noted, but at this stage, the overall attack volume was the lowest observed during the month.

**2. Putin Warns of Escalation (October 3rd)**

*   **Total Attacks (Oct 2-4):** 680,518
*   **Top Attacking Countries:** United States, Brazil, Germany, **Ukraine**
*   **Analysis:** A dramatic increase in attack volume was observed, nearly doubling from the previous period. This suggests that the heightened political rhetoric had an immediate and significant impact on the cyber threat landscape.

**3. Record Russian Drone and Missile Attacks on Ukraine (October 5th)**

*   **Total Attacks (Oct 4-6):** 548,757
*   **Top Attacking Countries:** United States, Germany, Brazil
*   **Analysis:** The most significant finding from this period is the disappearance of Ukraine from the top 10 attacking countries. This is a strong indication that Ukrainian cyber resources were redirected to a defensive posture in response to the massive real-world attacks.

**4. Russian Territorial Gains in Ukraine (culminating around October 7th)**

*   **Total Attacks (Oct 6-8):** 727,284
*   **Top Attacking Countries:** United States, **Romania**, Germany
*   **Analysis:** This period saw the first anomalous and massive surge in attacks from Romania, which became the second-largest source of attacks. This was the first indication of the large-scale botnet activity that would become a defining feature of the month.

**5. Russia Strikes Ukrainian Gas Infrastructure (October 16th)**

*   **Total Attacks (Oct 15-17):** 971,939
*   **Top Attacking Countries:** United States, **Russia**, Germany
*   **Analysis:** This is the most direct and compelling correlation observed during the investigation. On the same day as a major real-world attack on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, Russia became the second-largest source of attacks on our honeypots. This activity coincided with a publicly reported, sophisticated malware attack by the Russian state-sponsored group Sandworm targeting the Ukrainian military. The combination of a broad increase in attack traffic observed by our honeypots and a specific, targeted cyber operation provides very strong evidence of a multi-faceted, coordinated hybrid warfare campaign.

**6. NATO Airspace Violations (October 20th)**

*   **Total Attacks (Oct 19-21):** 787,331
*   **Top Attacking Countries:** United States, The Netherlands, Italy, Germany, **Ukraine**
*   **Analysis:** Ukraine re-emerged as a top 5 source of attacks, suggesting a return to an offensive cyber posture. The Netherlands and Italy also emerged as significant sources of attacks, highlighting the dynamic nature of the threat landscape.

**7. Timor-Leste Joins ASEAN (October 26th)**

*   **Total Attacks (Oct 25-27):** 1,147,337
*   **Top Attacking Countries:** **Romania**, United States, Singapore
*   **Analysis:** This period saw the highest attack volume of the month, with over 1.1 million attacks. Romania became the top source of attacks by a huge margin, with over 370,000 attacks, confirming the massive scale of the botnet activity originating from the country. The increase in attacks from Singapore is also noteworthy given the ASEAN context.

**8. Continued Russian Offensive near Pokrovsk (October 27-28)**

*   **Total Attacks (Oct 27-29):** 775,691
*   **Top Attacking Countries:** United States, **Romania**, Hong Kong, The Netherlands, China, India, Germany, Indonesia, **Russia**
*   **Analysis:** Russia re-appeared in the top 10, coinciding with the intensified military offensive on the ground. Romania remained a top source of attacks, consistent with the ongoing botnet activity.

**Conclusion**

The analysis of our honeypot data from October 2025 provides a clear and concerning picture of the modern cyber threat landscape. The events of this month demonstrate that real-world geopolitical conflicts, particularly the war in Ukraine, have a direct, immediate, and measurable impact on cyber activity.

The emergence of Russia as a top attacker in direct coordination with a physical military strike and a targeted cyber-operation is a stark reminder of the hybrid nature of modern warfare. The massive botnet activity originating from Romania highlights the scale and complexity of the global cybercrime ecosystem and its potential to be leveraged in times of conflict.

The dynamic and ever-changing nature of the threat landscape, with new countries constantly emerging as top sources of attacks, underscores the need for constant vigilance and a robust and adaptable cybersecurity posture. The findings of this report should be considered a clear warning of the volatile and unpredictable nature of the cyber domain in an era of heightened geopolitical tensions.
