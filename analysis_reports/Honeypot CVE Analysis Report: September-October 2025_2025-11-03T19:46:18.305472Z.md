**Files Used:** This report was generated using live search queries to the elasticsearch database.

**Fact-Check Summary:**

The initial report accurately identified that no CVEs from the year 2025 were detected. The list of top 5 CVEs and their corresponding counts was also correct. However, the total number of CVE alerts was slightly miscalculated in the original report. The corrected total is provided below.

**Summary of Findings:**

During the specified timeframe, a total of 230,104 CVE alerts were recorded. A thorough analysis of the data reveals that **no CVEs with the year 2025 were detected** in our honeypot network. The most frequently observed CVEs were from previous years, indicating that attackers are still actively exploiting older vulnerabilities.

The following table details the top 5 CVEs that were most frequently detected during the reporting period:

| Rank | CVE ID | Count |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | CVE-2006-2369 | 163,213 |
| 2 | CVE-2005-4050 | 47,388 |
| 3 | CVE-2002-0013, CVE-2002-0012 | 5,848 |
| 4 | CVE-2002-0013, CVE-2002-0012, CVE-1999-0517 | 3,149 |
| 5 | CVE-2021-44228 | 2,872 |

**Conclusion:**

While no CVEs for the year 2025 have been detected, the high volume of alerts for older CVEs suggests that attackers continue to leverage known vulnerabilities. This highlights the importance of maintaining robust security measures and ensuring that all systems are patched against known threats. It is recommended to continue monitoring for new CVEs and to prioritize the remediation of older, still-exploited vulnerabilities.
