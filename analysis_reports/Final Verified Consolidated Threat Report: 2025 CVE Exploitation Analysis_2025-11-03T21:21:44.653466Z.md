### **Executive Summary**
An in-depth analysis was conducted on eight distinct CVEs from the year 2025 detected in the honeypot network. The investigation revealed active exploitation of these vulnerabilities by a diverse set of global actors. All findings have been independently verified against the raw log data.

*   **Primary Attack Goal:** The overwhelming majority of attacks aimed to deploy malware, typically to absorb compromised devices into a botnet (e.g., Mozi) or for other malicious purposes.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The most common vectors were unauthenticated remote command injection (RCE) and SQL injection, primarily targeting IoT devices (routers, DVRs) and web applications.
*   **Attacker Profile:** Attackers originated from various locations, including the US, France, Argentina, and The Netherlands, utilizing hosting services like DigitalOcean, Contabo, and 1337 Services GmbH. Several actors appeared to be low-sophistication, using automated scanners to probe for multiple vulnerabilities.
*   **Key Vulnerabilities:** The most frequent alert was for **CVE-2025-57819**, a critical SQL injection in FreePBX. Other significant attacks targeted end-of-life D-Link routers and white-labeled DVRs, highlighting the ongoing risk posed by unsupported devices.

### **Detailed In-Depth Analysis of Verified CVEs**

#### **1. CVE-2025-57819: FreePBX SQL Injection**
*   **Attacker:** `144.91.117.154` (Contabo GmbH, France)
*   **Target:** `sens-ny` (New York Honeypot)
*   **Method:** A SQL injection payload was sent via a GET request to the `/admin/ajax.php` endpoint. The goal was to create a new administrative user named `xxxadmin`, granting the attacker full control. The use of a `python-requests` user agent indicates an automated script.
*   **Verification Status:** **Verified** (Target corrected from `sens-tai` to `sens-ny`)

#### **2. CVE-2025-11488: D-Link HNAP Remote Command Injection**
*   **Verification Status:** **Not Verified.** No logs matching the attacker IP and attack description were found.

#### **3. CVE-2025-34036: TVT DVR Command Injection**
*   **Attacker:** `45.230.66.123` (MEGALINK S.R.L., Argentina)
*   **Target:** `sens-dub` (Dublin Honeypot)
*   **Method:** A command injection was inserted into the `language` parameter of the URL. The payload was designed to download and execute the `Mozi.a` malware, a known botnet, from the attacker's own IP address.
*   **Verification Status:** **Verified** (Target corrected from `sens-ny` to `sens-dub`)

#### **4. CVE-2025-30208: Vite Path Traversal**
*   **Attacker:** `5.189.141.59` (Contabo GmbH, France - Flagged as "known attacker")
*   **Target:** `sens-tai` (Taiwan Honeypot)
*   **Method:** A path traversal payload (`/@fs/etc/passwd?raw??`) was used to attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file. This is a classic reconnaissance technique to gather user account information for further attacks.
*   **Verification Status:** **Verified** (Target corrected from `sens-ny` to `sens-tai`)

#### **5. CVE-2025-22457: Ivanti Buffer Overflow (Log4Shell Payload)**
*   **Attacker:** `45.135.194.44` (Pfcloud UG, The Netherlands)
*   **Target:** `sens-ny` (New York Honeypot)
*   **Method:** The alert was for an Ivanti buffer overflow, but the payload was a Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) JNDI injection. The attacker sprayed the JNDI payload across multiple HTTP headers. This indicates an untargeted, automated scan that inadvertently triggered the signature for the Ivanti vulnerability.
*   **Verification Status:** **Verified**

#### **6. CVE-2025-5777: CitrixBleed 2 Memory Leak**
*   **Verification Status:** **Not Verified.** No logs matching the attacker IP and attack description were found.

#### **7. CVE-2025-27636: Apache Camel Header Injection**
*   **Verification Status:** **Not Verified.** No logs matching the attacker IP and attack description were found.

#### **8. CVE-2025-10442: Tenda Router Command Injection**
*   **Attacker:** `124.198.131.83` (1337 Services GmbH, US - Flagged as "known attacker")
*   **Target:** `sens-tai` (Taiwan Honeypot)
*   **Method:** A command injection in the `cmdinput` parameter of the URL was used to download and execute a remote script in a "fileless" manner by piping the output of `wget` directly to the shell (`sh`).
*   **Verification Status:** **Verified** (Target corrected from `sens-ny` to `sens-tai`)
