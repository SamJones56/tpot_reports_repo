# Honeypot Attack Research Report

**Report Generation Time:** 2025-10-28T15:33:12.582589Z
**Timeframe of Analysis:** 2025-09-28T15:30:20.093215Z to 2025-10-28T15:30:20.093215Z

## Objective
To identify potential zero-day exploits or fingerprints of zero-day activity within the honeypot network data from the last month.

## Methodology
The investigation involved live querying of the honeypot data, focusing on unusual and infrequent alert signatures. The methodology was as follows:
1.  **Initial Triage:** Began by searching for rare CVEs, but the tooling was not optimal for this approach. Pivoted to analyzing alert signatures that might indicate novel attack vectors.
2.  **Signature Analysis:** Investigated a series of suspicious alert signatures, including those related to known exploits, SSH banner anomalies, web server requests from Python clients, and RDP scanning.
3.  **Deep Dive and External Research:** For each signature of interest, a deep dive was conducted using `match_query`. The `search_agent` was used to cross-reference findings with publicly available threat intelligence.

## Files Used to Generate Report
*   Live query results from the Elasticstack database.
*   External threat intelligence gathered via the `search_agent`.

## Summary of Findings
The investigation did not uncover any evidence of zero-day exploits. The suspicious activity that was analyzed was found to be attributable to known exploits, malware, or common reconnaissance techniques.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Alert Signature: `ET EXPLOIT [PTsecurity] DoublePulsar Backdoor installation communication`
*   **Analysis:** This signature was investigated as a potential indicator of a novel exploit. However, research quickly confirmed that DoublePulsar is a well-documented backdoor, famously used in the WannaCry ransomware attacks of 2017. The associated exploits and CVEs (CVE-2017-0144, etc.) are widely known.
*   **Conclusion:** This activity is not a zero-day exploit.

### 2. Alert Signature: `SURICATA SSH invalid banner`
*   **Analysis:** This alert was investigated as it could indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the SSH banner parsing logic. The investigation revealed that the alerts were generated by a variety of clients, including the `ZGrab` and `nmap` network scanners, as well as custom clients written in `Go`. The malformed banners were simple and did not contain any exploit code.
*   **Conclusion:** This activity is consistent with reconnaissance and fingerprinting of SSH servers, not a zero-day exploit.

### 3. Alert Signature: `ET INFO User-Agent (python-requests) Inbound to Webserver`
*   **Analysis:** This signature revealed a variety of scripted activities, including scanning for common vulnerabilities and brute-force login attempts. Of particular interest was a `POST` request with the payload `0x%5B%5D=androxgh0st`. Research identified "Androxgh0st" as a known Python-based webshell that targets `.env` files in Laravel applications. The FBI and CISA have issued advisories on this malware.
*   **Conclusion:** This activity is associated with a known malware campaign and is not a zero-day exploit.

### 4. Alert Signature: `ET SCAN MS Terminal Server Traffic on Non-standard Port`
*   **Analysis:** The investigation of this signature revealed clear evidence of port scanning activity. The `payload_printable` field contained the string `Cookie: mstshash=nmap`, which is a clear indicator of the `nmap` network scanner being used to identify open RDP ports.
*   **Conclusion:** This is standard reconnaissance activity and not a zero-day exploit.

## Overall Conclusion
While the honeypot network is subject to a high volume of malicious activity, this investigation did not identify any indicators of compromise that would suggest the presence of a zero-day exploit. The observed attacks and reconnaissance activities are all related to known and well-documented threats. It is recommended to continue monitoring the honeypot network for new and unusual activity.
