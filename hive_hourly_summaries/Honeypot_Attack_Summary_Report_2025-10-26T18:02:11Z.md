### Key Observations and Anomalies

*   **High-Volume Scanners:** The vast majority of events were generated by a few IP addresses, suggesting automated scanning campaigns targeting common vulnerabilities and open ports, especially SIP (5060) and SSH (22).
*   **Malware Delivery Attempts:** Several commands indicate attempts to download and execute malicious scripts (`w.sh`, `c.sh`, `wget.sh`) from remote servers. This is a common tactic for establishing a foothold for botnets or other malware.
*   **SSH Key Manipulation:** The repeated attempts to modify `.ssh/authorized_keys` are a clear indication of attackers trying to gain persistent access to compromised systems.
*   **System Enumeration:** The extensive use of commands like `uname`, `lscpu`, `free`, and `df` shows that attackers are performing detailed reconnaissance of the honeypot environment to understand its architecture and resources.
*   **Lack of Sophistication:** While the volume of attacks is high, the techniques observed are generally not sophisticated, relying on common exploits and brute-force methods. The credentials attempted are mostly default or weak passwords.
