## Executive Summary

This report summarizes a total of 17,283 malicious events recorded across the honeypot network during the specified timeframe. The majority of the activity was captured by the Cowrie honeypot (7,584 events), indicating a high volume of SSH and Telnet based attacks. A significant number of security alerts were also generated by Suricata (2,962 events), with a notable prevalence of signatures related to the DoublePulsar backdoor, suggesting attempts to exploit SMB vulnerabilities. The most active attacking IP address observed was `92.118.39.92`, responsible for 1,378 events. Network attacks were primarily concentrated on SMTP (Port 25), SMB (Port 445), and SSH (Port 22). Attackers actively attempted to exploit several vulnerabilities, with CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) being the most frequently targeted. Common post-exploitation techniques included attempts to modify SSH `authorized_keys` for persistence and executing system reconnaissance commands.

## Key Observations and Anomalies

1.  **High-Volume Exploitation:** The repeated triggering of the "DoublePulsar Backdoor" signature is a major concern, indicating automated attempts to exploit the SMB vulnerability previously associated with the WannaCry ransomware attacks.
2.  **Credential Stuffing:** The wide variety of usernames and passwords attempted, especially the top credential `345gs5662d34/345gs5662d34`, suggests large-scale, automated brute-force attacks against SSH.
3.  **Automated Reconnaissance & Persistence:** The most common commands are part of a clear pattern: an attacker gains access, performs basic system reconnaissance (`uname`, `whoami`, `lscpu`), and then immediately attempts to ensure persistent access by adding their own SSH key to `authorized_keys`. The use of `chattr` and `lockr` suggests an attempt to make their changes immutable.
4.  **Targeted Vulnerability Scanning:** The continued focus on CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) shows that attackers are still actively scanning for this critical vulnerability across the internet.
5.  **Multi-stage Payload Delivery:** The download of multiple shell scripts (`wget.sh`, `w.sh`, `c.sh`) by an attacker from IP `151.242.30.16` indicates a multi-stage attack to establish a stronger foothold on the compromised system.
